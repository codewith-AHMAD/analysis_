# Divvy Bicycle Data Analysis
## Chicago's Cycling Patterns
By analyzing trip patterns, popular stations, and temporal trends, we aim to gain valuable insights into urban mobility and transportation. This analysis is not just about numbers; it's about understanding how people move within their city and how we can make that movement even better.

## What have been done so far
Data Exploration & Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and transformed raw Divvy data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Feature Engineering: 
* Created new features, such as time of day, to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data.

### Geospatial Analysis:
* Utilized GeoPandas to work with the geographic data of the Divvy stations.

### Interactive Mapping: 
* Created a map of Divvy stations using Folium, laying the groundwork for future interactive visualizations.

### Temporal Analysis: 
* Examined hourly ride counts for popular stations, providing insights into peak usage times.

## Room for Development: Let's Collaborate
This project provides a solid starting point, and there are several avenues for further exploration :

### Interactive Dashboard: 
* Develop a dashboard (e.g., using Plotly or Dash) to enable users to explore the data, filter by station or time, and visualize trends.

### Advanced Geospatial Analysis:

* Visualize popular routes by creating a heatmap of ride origins and destinations.

* Analyze station locations to identify areas with potential gaps in service.

* Develop a model to predict bike demand at different locations and times.

### Predictive Modeling:

* Build models to predict ride duration or bike availability, considering factors like time of day, day of week, and weather.

* Use machine learning to group stations based on usage patterns.


### Impact of Events:
* Analyze the influence of special events or weather conditions on Divvy usage.

## Let's collaborate to enhance this project and create a useful resource for understanding urban mobility in Chicago.
